LambdaCalculus
==============

Scala implementation of a [lambda calculus][] interpreter.

[lambda calculus]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus  "Lambda Calculus"


Installing
-----------

LambdaCalculus is set up as an SBT project.  See the SBT guide for instructions
on [how to set up SBT][Setup], [get the project running][RunningSbt] with an interactive
console, or how to build a jar.

Usage
------

First import the Expression object:

    import us.sitr.lambdacalculus.Expression

Define a lambda calculus expression using a string.  You can use an actual
lambda character or a backslash to represent a lambda:

    scala> Expression("(\\m.\\n.\\f.\\x.m f (n f x)) (\\f.\\x.f x) (\\f.\\x.f (f x))")
    res1: us.sitr.lambdacalculus.Expression = (λm.λn.λf.λx.m f (n f x)) (λf.λx.f x) (λf.λx.f (f x))

Methods are available for performing the various conversions:

    scala> Expression("(\\ab.ba) c").betaReduction
    res2: us.sitr.lambdacalculus.Expression = λb.b c

    scala> Expression("\\x.f x").etaConversion
    res3: us.sitr.lambdacalculus.Expression = f

To perform an alpha conversion you must provide a Set of variables that you
want to eliminate from the expression:

    scala> import us.sitr.lambdacalculus.Var
    import us.sitr.lambdacalculus.Var
    
    scala> Expression("\\ab.ba") alphaConversion Set(Var("a"))
    res4: us.sitr.lambdacalculus.Expression = λa'.λb.b a'

You can reduce an expression to its simplest form using the `evaluate` method:

    scala> Expression("(\\m.\\n.\\f.\\x.m f (n f x)) (\\f.\\x.f x) (\\f.\\x.f (f x))").evaluate
    res5: us.sitr.lambdacalculus.Expression = λf.λx.f (f (f x))

You can also get interactive evaluation by passing a callback to `evaluate`:

    scala> Expression("(\\m.\\n.\\f.\\x.m f (n f x)) (\\f.\\x.f x) (\\f.\\x.f (f x))") evaluate { println(_) }
    (λm.λn.λf.λx.m f (n f x)) (λf.λx.f x) (λf.λx.f (f x))
    (λn.λf.λx.(λf.λx.f x) f (n f x)) (λf.λx.f (f x))
    λf.λx.(λf.λx.f x) f ((λf.λx.f (f x)) f x)
    λf.λx.(λx.f x) ((λf.λx.f (f x)) f x)
    λf.λx.f ((λf.λx.f (f x)) f x)
    λf.λx.f ((λx.f (f x)) x)
    λf.λx.f (f (f x))
    res6: us.sitr.lambdacalculus.Expression = λf.λx.f (f (f x))

Finally, to save you some typing there are some predefined constants that you
can use in expressions:

    scala> Expression("+ 1 2").evaluate
    res7: us.sitr.lambdacalculus.Expression = λf.λx.f (f (f x))

Here is the complete list of constants available:

    "0"     -> "λfx.x",
    "1"     -> "λfx.f x",
    "2"     -> "λfx.f (f x)",
    "3"     -> "λfx.f (f (f x))",
    "SUCC"  -> "λnfx.f (n f x)",
    "+"     -> "λmnfx.m f (n f x)",
    "*"     -> "λmn.m (+ n) 0",
    "^"     -> "λbe.e b",  // exponentiation
    "PRED"  -> "λnfx.n (λgh.h (g f)) (λu.x) (λu.u)",
    "-"     -> "λmn.n PRED m",
    "TRUE"  -> "λxy.x",
    "FALSE" -> "λxy.y",
    "&&"    -> "λpq.p q p",
    "||"    -> "λpq.p p q",
    "!"     -> "λpab.p b a"  // negation


Why should you care?
---------------------

Maybe you are a lambda calculus fan; or maybe you just have some compsci
homework to do.  Evaluating lambda calculus expressions with a computer is a
lot less tedious than doing so by hand.

On the other hand, maybe you are a Scala fan.  Part of the reason I wrote this
program was to get some practice with Scala's parser combinator library.  You
can use the code here as an example if you are also interested in parsing with
Scala.

To learn more about Scala's parsing libraries I recommend reading chapter 31 in
Odersky's Programming in Scala.
